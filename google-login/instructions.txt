Requirements: Flask, Python venv, Flask Authlib

1) Navigate to the google-login directory via cmd
2) Start a python virtual environment with the command "python -m venv venv"
3) Install the authlib module with the command "pip install authlib"
4) Next, execute the following command: ".\env\Scripts\Activate
5) Set the flask app to app.py by the command: "set FLASK_APP=app"
6) Run the app on localhost with the command: "flask run"
7) Open the following URL in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/home
8) Sign in with google using the button located at the bottom of the page
9) Once finished, turn off the app by pressing "control + c" twice 

Other pages accessible:

1) - http://127.0.0.1:5000/answer
	This page was intended to be redicrected to after signing in. As can be seen, 
	when signed in with google button at http://127.0.0.1:5000/home, the page 
	/answer retains this status

2) - http://127.0.0.1:5000/
	This page is the main page and includes a simple message, which changes to
	 greet the user once login is performed via(next link)

3) - http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
	This page lets user login with google account. It has a faulty redirect,
	however, the user can visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ after logging in, and
	view the changed message, which should greet the user by his e-mail

Furhter information

	Should this authentication method be expanded upon, Flask Authlib allows 
	the use of the"@login_required" declarator to make certain pages only 
	accessible to users who have been validated by google and are logged in.

	Furthermore, in the python code, proper redirects can be set up, so users
	are pointed to a specific page once google authenticates them via either
 	the button or /login link.

	https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and navigate to the
	"+ create credentials" tab.
