## Submitting your code

1. We use protected `master` branch,
   so the only way to push your code is via pull request
2. We use issue branches: to implement a new feature or to fix a bug
   create a new branch named `issue-$TASKNUMBER`
3. Then create a pull request to `master` branch

So, this way we achieve an easy and scalable development process
which frees us from merging hell and long-living branches.

In this method, the latest version of the app is always in the `master` branch.

### Before submitting

Before submitting your code please do the following steps:

1. Run `pytest` to make sure everything was working before
2. Add any changes you want
3. Add tests for the new changes
4. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
5. Run `pytest` again to make sure it is still working
6. Run `flake8` to ensure that style is correct


## Tests

We use `pytest` and `flake8` for quality control.


To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```
